## a Fork of a Fork
Forks are like turtles. It's forks all the way down.
I opted to fork this fork of Ant-Contrib since I have a mind of my own of making some changes.
Also, I'm unable to get access to the original site at sourceforge (firewall blocked.) 

That's an inconvenience. So at the very least, I intend to build and have a release here, and
if time allows, I'll add changes of my own and submit upstream.

# Original Note.

This is a fork of the Ant Contrib project (http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/).
At the time of the fork (October 2011) the project had been inactive for a number
of years with developers citing lack of time to support it.

In the meantime, many user contributed patches and additions have been posted to
SourceForge forums (https://sourceforge.net/p/ant-contrib/_list/tickets). A git
fork seemed like a no brainer...
